    <h3>Potential upcoming changes</h3>
      <p>Arm is constantly exploring ways to make the architecture presentation precise and clear. Towards this, the following changes are expected in future releases:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Accessibility of unimplemented registers in indexed register arrays will be improved.</li>
        <li>Accessibility for memory mapped accesses to registers will be improved.</li>
        <li>Accessibility when there is a width mismatch between the accessor and the register will be improved.</li>
        <li>Configurability details will be captured more formally to define features, acceptable feature choices, and mapping of features to ID registers.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The details of the architecture are presented in pseudocode in Architecture Specification Language (ASL). Arm is defining a new version of the Architecture Specification Language, ASL1, to improve and expand the capabilities of the language. Please see https://developer.arm.com/Architectures/Architecture%20Specification%20Language for details on this language. Arm will be publishing an equivalent release in ASL1 format later in 2025.</p>

      <h3>Intention and quality statements for all ArmARM architecture releases</h3>
      <p>The intention and scope of the <b>Architecture releases</b> is to describe changes from the existing architecture to the next release. The quality of the architecture releases refers to the accuracy and completeness of the changes described in the specifications.</p>
      <p>The intention and scope of the <b>XML releases</b> is to describe the content and behavior of the registers, system registers, instructions, pseudocode and features of the architecture in full, for human readers in a way that enables correct information for the current or any previous release can be deduced. The quality of the XML releases refers to the accuracy and completeness of the content to a human reader.</p>
      <p>The intention and scope of the <b>JSON releases</b> is to describe aspects of the XML releases in a structured, machine readable format. The content of the architectural content will be approximately equivalent to the corresponding XML release. However there are some aspects of the architecture which cannot yet be represented in a machine readable format.</p>
      <p>The intention and scope of the <b>Schema</b> for the JSON releases is to describe the syntax and format of the json files used in the json releases. The schema is still under development and is subject to change.</p>

    <h2><a name="documentation"/>Documentation</h2>

    <h3>General</h3>    <p>
      A description within the XML contains the following sections:
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Purpose</dt>
      <dd>
        A short description of the purpose of the register in the
        Arm Architecture.
      </dd>      <dt>Configuration</dt>
      <dd>
        How the register is architecturally mapped onto another System
        register or a memory-mapped register.  If the configuration of
        the PE affects the implementation of the register, then
        information about this is also included here.
      </dd>      <dt>Attributes</dt>
      <dd>
        The size of the register.
      </dd>      <dt>Field descriptions</dt>
      <dd>
        The register diagram and a description of the behavior of each field within the register.
      </dd>
    </dl>    <h3>Memory-mapped registers</h3>
    <p>
      A memory-mapped register description also contains the following
      sections:
    </p>    <dl>
      <dt>Accessing ...</dt>
      <dd>
        The address or offset of the register in the memory map, and
        the accessibility.
      </dd>

    </dl>    <h3>System registers</h3>

    <p>
      A System register description also contains an "Accessing
      ..." section, that includes:      <ul>
        <li>
          The assembler syntax for the instructions used to access the
          register, and how the instruction is encoded.
        </li>        <li>
          Pseudocode that describes the execution of all instructions
          used to access the register, including information about
          traps and enables that apply upon that access.
        </li>        <li>
          For some System registers, additional text is provided which
          gives extra information regarding the access to the
          register.
        </li>        <li>
          The accessibility pseudocode for a register assumes that
          that register is implemented and that all features which
          affect its accesses are implemented. In most cases, the
          behavior upon access to a register is determined in part or
          in whole by the Exception level at which it is accessed.
        </li>
      </ul>    </p>
